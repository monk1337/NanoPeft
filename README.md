# Why NanoPeft?
- Hacking the Hugging Face PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) or LitGit packages seems like a lot of work to integrate a new LoRA method quickly and benchmark it.
- By keeping the code so simple, it is very easy to hack to your needs, add new LoRA methods from papers in the layers/ directory, and fine-tune easily as per your needs.
- This is mostly for experimental/research purposes, not for scalable solutions.
